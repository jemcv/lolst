### Basic Concepts

#### What is LOLst? 
LOLst is a Bash script that fetches League of Legends player statistics from op.gg and displays them in your terminal. It's like having op.gg in your command line!

#### Key Features 
- üöÄ Fetches real-time player stats
- üé® Colorful terminal output
- ‚è≥ Loading animation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling
- üåç Region validation
- üèÖ Rank-based emoji display

### Script Structure

This section sets up the script‚Äôs environment, including color codes and the list of valid regions.

#### 1. Script Setup 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Colors and configuration
Color_Off='\033[0m'
Red='\033[0;31m'
Green='\033[0;32m'
# ... more colors

# Valid regions list
valid_regions=("na" "euw" "eune" "kr" "jp" ...)
```

#### 2. Main Functions 
The script is organized into several key functions:

```bash
# Function Overview
display_ascii_art()  # Shows the welcome screen
validate_inputs()    # Checks user input
loader()             # Shows loading animation
cleanup()            # Handles interruptions
fetch_data()         # Gets data from op.gg
extract_data()       # Processes the data
display_results()    # Shows the results
main()               # Orchestrates everything
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Input Validation
```bash
validate_inputs() {
    # Check if region is valid
    if [[ ! ${valid_regions[*]} =~ ${region} ]]; then
        echo -e "${Red}Error: Invalid region...${Color_Off}"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Check summoner name format
    if [[ ! $summoner_name =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$ ]]; then
        echo -e "${Red}Error: Summoner name should only contain...${Color_Off}"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```
- Region is valid
- Summoner name uses correct characters
- Neither input is empty

#### 2. Data Fetching
```bash
fetch_data() {
    if ! curl_content=$(curl -s "$url"); then
        echo -e "${Red}Failed to fetch data from $url${Color_Off}"
        kill $loader_pid
        exit 1
    fi
    kill $loader_pid
}
```
- Uses `curl` to fetch webpage
- Silent mode (`-s`) suppresses progress and error messages
- Error handling for failed requests

#### 3. Data Extraction
```bash
extract_data() {
    # Extract tier information
    tier=$(echo "$curl_content" | grep -oP '(?<=<div class="tier">)[^<]+' | head -n 1)
    
    # Extract LP
    lp=$(echo "$curl_content" | grep -o '<div class="[^"]*lp[^"]*">[^<]*' | 
         sed -e 's/<[^>]*>//g' | head -n 1)
    
    # More extractions...
}
```
- Uses grep with regex to extract tier info.
- Extracts LP (League Points) using grep and sed.
- Cleans the output by removing html tags.

#### 4. Results Display
```bash
display_results() {
    # Rank emoji mapping
    case "$tier" in
        "iron") rank_emoji="ü™ì" ;;
        "bronze") rank_emoji="ü•â" ;;
        # ... more ranks
    esac

    # Display formatted results
    echo -e "${Blue}| üÜî Summoner: $summoner_name ${Color_Off}"
    echo -e "${Green}| üéÆ Level: $level ${Color_Off}"
    # ... more stats
}
```
- Displays the summoner name with formatting.
- Maps the tier to an emoji for visual representation.
- Outputs the additional stats like level, LP, and more.

#### 5. Loading Animation
```bash
loader() {
    chars="/-\|"
    while :; do
        for ((i = 0; i < ${#chars}; i++)); do
            sleep 0.1
            echo -en "${Yellow}‚åõ Loading...${chars:$i:1}" "\r${Color_Off}"
        done
    done
}
```
- Creates a spinning animation for the loading state.
- Iterates through characters (/, -, \, |) to animate the loading indicator.
- Runs continuously until data fetching is completed.

#### 6. Signal Handling
```bash
cleanup() {
    echo -e "\n${Red}‚ùå Aborted.${Color_Off}"
    if kill -0 "$loader_pid" 2>/dev/null; then
        kill "$loader_pid"
    fi
    exit 1
}

# In main()
trap cleanup SIGINT
```
- Displays an error message when the script is aborted.
- Checks if the loader process is running, and kills it if necessary.
- Uses trap to catch SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and trigger the cleanup function.

### Unix Tools Deep Dive

#### curl
- **What it does**: Downloads web pages
- **How we use it**: `curl -s "https://www.op.gg/summoners/kr/HideOnBush-Kr1"`
- **Why it's useful**: Gets player data from op.gg

#### grep
- **What it does**: Finds patterns in text
- **How we use it**: `grep -oP '(?<=<div class="tier">)[^<]+'`
- **Why it's useful**: Extracts specific pieces of information

#### sed
- **What it does**: Modifies text streams
- **How we use it**: `sed -e 's/<[^>]*>//g'`
- **Why it's useful**: Cleans up HTML tags

#### awk
- **What it does**: Processes text
- **How we use it**: `awk '{$1=$1};1'`
- **Why it's useful**: Formats output nicely

#### tr
- **What it does**: Translates or deletes characters
- **How we use it**: `echo "$curl_content" | tr -d '\n'`
- **Why it's useful**: Transform characters to delete new line

#### head
- **What it does**: Displays the beginning of a file or stream
- **How we use it**: `echo "$curl_content" | head -n 1`
- **Why it's useful**: Limits output to the first line

### Troubleshooting Guide 

#### 1. Installation Issues 
```bash
# Problem: "lolst: command not found"
lolst: command not found

# Solution:
# Check if the script is installed:
which lolst  

# Expected output:
# /usr/local/bin/lolst

# If no output is shown, re-install the script:
sudo curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jemcv/lolst/main/lolst.sh" -o /usr/local/bin/lolst && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lolst
```

#### 2. Data Fetching Issues 
```bash
# Problem: No data found
No rank info found for üÜî kr/HideOnBush

# Solutions:
# 1. Check connectivity with
ping www.op.gg

# 2. Check if op.gg is accessible in browser
# 3. Verify summoner name spelling
```

#### 3. Region Errors 
```bash
# Problem:
Error: Invalid region

# Solution:
# Use valid region from list:
lolst kr  HideOnBush-Kr1  # ‚úì "kr" is a valid region
lolst xyz HideOnBush-Kr1 # x "xyz" is an invalid region
```

#### 4. Check dependencies
```bash
# Make sure all dependencies are installed:
which curl grep sed awk tr head

# If installed, you'll see something like:
/usr/bin/curl
/usr/bin/sed
/usr/bin/awk
/usr/bin/tr
/usr/bin/head

# These tools are typically pre-installed on most Linux systems.
```

#### Tips for Learning 

1. **Try These Modifications**:
   ```bash
   # Add a new color
   Purple='\033[0;35m'
   
   # Modify the loading animation
   chars="‚óê‚óì‚óë‚óí"
   ```

2. **Debug with echo**:
   ```bash
   # Add debug outputs
   echo "DEBUG: Fetching data from $url"
   echo "DEBUG: Raw tier data: $tier"
   ```

3. **Experiment with Data**:
   ```bash
   # Try different summoner names
   lolst kr T1Gumayusi-KR1
   lolst kr HideonBush-KR1
   ```

Remember: The best way to learn is by doing! Try modifying the script and see what happens.

### Additional Notes

- This script relies on op.gg's HTML structure. If op.gg changes their layout, the script may need updates.
- This script performs web scraping, so it is dependent on op.gg's availability and rate limiting.
